# Nyan Cat Test Reporter for Visual Studio

A 'diagnostic data adapter'
that makes Nyan Cat fly across your screen
whilst your tests are running :3

## ðŸ”¨ Building and Installation
* Run Visual Studio as Administrator, if possible.
* Build solution.

 If you're Administrator, the post build script should copy the files:
 * `NyanCatReporterDataCollector\bin\Release\NyanCatReporterDataCollector.dll`
 * `NyanCatReporterDataCollector\bin\Release\NyanCatDisplay.dll`

 into `%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\PrivateAssemblies\DataCollectors\`.
 Otherwise you'll have to do it yourself.

### âš™ Configuring your test project
* Add a `.runsettings` file to your test project, if you don't already have one.
 * See `UnitTestProject1\.runsettings` as an example. You just need the `DataCollector` element with the friendlyName, uri, and assemblyQualifiedName attributes set.
* Open your test project in VS.
* From the menu, select **Test** > **Test Settings** > **Select Test Settings File**
* Choose the `.runsettings` file and click **Open**.
#### Configuring your test classes
* Add a cleanup method like `CloseTestDiscoveryEngine()` from from the example project into your TestClass.
  * This is a workaround for a problem where you can't use Nyan Cat twice in a row.
